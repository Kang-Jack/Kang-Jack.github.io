I have been lives in Beijing since 2001. Compare with the history of this city, it just a small number of years in peacefull age. But it is a golden age for me to grow with this city from a fresh out college student to a father.

## What about the blog
This blog is to share some technical/interesting/innovational things or story made me feel funny, and wish can also enjoy your life.
